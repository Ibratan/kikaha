Kikaha is a micro container writen over the fast Undertow core. It was developed with two core ideas in mind:
- provides a lightweight micro container (written over the powerful undertow core), as alternative environment to to run web applications
- provide a set of undertow extensions to structure and initialize your application without writing a bunch of bootstraping lines of code, making easier to develop embedded applications
