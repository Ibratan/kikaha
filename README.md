Kikaha is a micro container writen over the fast Undertow core. It was developed with two core ideas in mind:
- provides a lightweight micro container (written over the powerful undertow core), as alternative environment to to run web applications
- provide a set of undertow extensions to structure and initialize your application without writing a bunch of bootstraping lines of code, making easier to develop embedded applications

## Who is it for?
Kikaha is for you if one of the bellow statements are true for your needs:
- A full featured Web Container (like JBoss, Wildfly, GlassFish, etc) is considered overwhelming for my software needs
- Servlet API is a boring development environment
- My SaaS application is changing to a micro-services architecture
- I want to create a software adopting the micro-services architecture principle
- I want to do something impressively fast on the web
- I want to have some fun developing a web software in JVM environment
